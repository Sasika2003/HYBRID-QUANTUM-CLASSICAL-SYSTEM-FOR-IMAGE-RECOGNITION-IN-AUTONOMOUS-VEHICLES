# HYBRID-QUANTUM-CLASSICAL-SYSTEM-FOR-IMAGE-RECOGNITION-IN-AUTONOMOUS-VEHICLES
The growth of autonomous vehicles has made
it essential to develop reliable perception
systems that can recognize and classify objects
in complex environments. Object recognition,
a key area of computer vision, directly impacts
a vehicle’s ability to make safe navigation
decisions like braking, accelerating, or lane
changes.          
This project focuses on building a quantumenhanced object classification model for selfdriving cars. Using a dataset sourced from
Kaggle’s Self-Driving Cars Dataset, five object
classes — car, truck, person, bicycle, and traffic
light — are extracted from annotated images
through bounding boxes.         
A hybrid classical-quantum model is developed
by combining quantum circuits built with
PennyLane and classical layers from
TensorFlow/Keras. Cropped object images are
encoded into quantum states to leverage
quantum feature mappings, followed by
classical processing for final classification. This
integration aims to enhance classification
performance and contribute to safer and more
efficient autonomous vehicle systems
